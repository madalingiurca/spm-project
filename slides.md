# Problem - one complex project

<div class="relative top-10">

- complex projects cannot rely on math and technology indefinitely
- complex or "mega projects" often engages market and non-market stakeholders as well
- while software, technologies, mathematical models are easily predictable, humans are not

</div>

# Problem - stakeholder alignment

When **innovation** wants to be taken into consideration for a project, the likelihood of stakeholders to be driven by
different views is higher.

## But why is it happening?

1. **Market vs non-market**
    - Think about building a bridge in a remote area compared to the same bridge in a dense populated area inside the
      city
2. **Cultural differences**
    - Starting from differences inside the organisation up to collaboration between multiple entities to achieve a goal
3. **Irrationality appearance**
    - Chasing different goals, the difference between success and failure can be the ability to work productively with "
      irrational" stakeholders

# Solution

## Design thinking process

<div class="relative left-10 top-10">
```mermaid {theme: 'neutral', scale: 1.5}
graph LR;
A(What is?) --> B(What if?);
B --> C(What wows?);
C --> D(What works?);
```
</div>

<div class="relative top-30">
<li><b>What is?</b> - generates knowledge by engaging stakeholders to discuss the solutions already in place</li>
<li><b>What if?</b> - idea generation process by removing the constraints and experimenting through prototyping</li>
<li><b>What wows?</b> - any hypothesis placed under testing for desirability and viability</li>
<li><b>What is?</b> - one higher fidelity prototype should exist and ready to be shaped for implementation</li>

</div>

# Evaluations

Two projects implemented in UK having the same goal:

***A viaduct crossing a massive lake in an area full of recreational activities.***

***
First group

- lack of community input
- rejection from local authorities
- designed as an imposing structure opposed to community views

Second group

- adopted a Design Thinking approach <fluent-brain-circuit-24-filled class="text-xl mx-2 animate-pulse"/>
- before a redesign took place there were other steps involved
- using the framework, the group tried to reach the public opinion on prototypes

<!--
community = non-market stakeholder
signature structure - interesting from market stakeholder pov

other steps involved: workshops, community meetings, architects, urban planners, etc

# Conclusions

- More time spent on project design doesn't mean resources wasted
- Design Thinking ~ a framework of tools and approaches on project planning

<!--
Design thinking is not here to replace traditional project management approaches, but to enhance
